## CREATE SHOPNOTES LAYOUT

1. yarn rw g layout ShopNotes

- This layout will display a header
- The header will include a button to add a new ShopNote

2. Add ShopNotesLayout to the HomePage.tsx

- In many cases, you add the layout to routes using the \<SET> component.
- In our app, we are calling the layout in the HomePage.tsx file.
