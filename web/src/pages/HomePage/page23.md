## PRODUCTION - SETUP RAILWAY

In order to run out app in production, we need to set up a database. We will use [Railway](https://railway.app/) to set up a Postgres database.

2. Create a new project
3. Select the "Provision Postgres" option
4. Click on the "Postgres" card that is displayed
5. Click on the "Connect" tab
6. Copy the "DATABASE_URL" to your clipboard and save it for later
