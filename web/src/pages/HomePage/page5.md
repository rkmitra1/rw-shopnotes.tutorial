## ASIDE: ADD MARKDOWN-TO-JSX

In our application we will use Markdown. For this we would like to use the 'markdown-to-jsx' package.

1. <p className="aside">On initally running storybook in Redwoodjs, storybook adds additional packages. These packages (including markdown-to-jsx) are available to use in your app</p>

2. yarn rw storybook

- note: the first execution of storybook will add the packages. Thus, you do not need to run the regular yarn add command.
